Bismark report for: se_directional/se_directional.fq.gz (version: v0.10.0)
Option '--directional' specified: alignments to complementary strands will be ignored (i.e. not performed!)
Bowtie was run against the bisulfite genome of /usr/local/work/hickey/genomes/hg19_bowtie2/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	10000
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	8120
Mapping efficiency:	81.2%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	1175
Sequences did not map uniquely:	705
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	4046	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	4074	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
