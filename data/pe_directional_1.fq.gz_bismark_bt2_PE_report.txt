Bismark report for: pe_directional_1.fq.gz and pe_directional_2.fq.gz (version: v0.12.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /usr/local/work/hickey/genomes/hg19_bowtie2/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	10000
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	6655
Mapping efficiency:	66.5% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	2789
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	556
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	3304	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	3351	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
