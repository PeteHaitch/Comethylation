<h1>
<a name="comethylation" class="anchor" href="#comethylation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>comethylation</h1>

<p><code>comethylation</code> is a methylation caller for methylation events that co-occur on the same DNA fragment from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data, such as <code>methylC-seq</code>. A typical read from such an experiment reports a binary methylated or unmethylated measurement at multiple loci, where each read originates from a single cell. <code>comethylation</code> allows us to investigate the co-occurence of methylation marks at the level of a single cell.</p>

<h1>
<a name="installation-and-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#installation-and-dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation and dependencies</h1>

<p>Simply running </p>

<pre><code>python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>in the root <code>comethylation</code> directory should work for most systems.</p>

<p><code>comethylation</code> is written in Python and relies upon the pysam module. Running <code>python setup.py install</code> will attempt to install pysam if it isn't found on your system. Alternatively, pysam is available from <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pysam/">https://code.google.com/p/pysam/</a>.</p>

<p><code>comethylation</code> has only been tested on Python 2.7 with pysam v0.7.7.</p>

<h1>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<h2>
<a name="method" class="anchor" href="#method"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Method</h2>

<p><code>comethylation</code> extracts <em>m-tuples</em> of methylation loci that co-occur on the same read. The simplest <em>m-tuple</em> is the 1-tuple (m = 1), which corresponds to counting the number of reads that are methylated (<em>M</em>) and unmethylated (<em>U</em>) for each cytosine in the genome; 1-tuples are the type of methylation calling performed by most methylation calling software such as Bismark's <code>bismark_methylation_extractor</code>. </p>

<p>A 2-tuple (m = 2) is a pair of methylation loci; <code>comethylation</code> tabulates the number of reads that methylated at each locus in the pair (<em>MM</em>), both unmethylated (<em>UU</em>) or methylated at one locus but not the other (<em>MU</em> or <em>UM</em>). This idea extends to 3-tuples, 4-tuples, etc. </p>

<p>For a chosen value of <em>m</em>, all <em>m-tuples</em> are extracted and tabulated across the genome. The key point is that <em>m-tuples</em> are only constructed if all <em>m</em> loci are within a single read, so we can investigate the co-occurence of methylation events at the level of a single cell.</p>

<h2>
<a name="basic-usage" class="anchor" href="#basic-usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic usage</h2>

<p><code>comethylation</code> processes a single <code>BAM</code> file and works for both single-end and paired-end sequencing data. Example <code>BAM</code> files from single-end directional and paired-end directional bisulfite-sequencing experiments are available in the <code>data/</code> directory. </p>

<p>Methylation measurements may be filtered by base quality or other criteria such as the mapping quality of the read or whether the read is marked as a PCR duplicate. For a full list of filtering options, please run <code>comethylation --help</code> or see the <strong>Advanced Usage</strong> section below. </p>

<p>Currently, the BAM file must have been created with <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/download.html#bismark">Bismark</a>. If the data were aligned with Bismark version &lt; 0.8.3 please use the <code>--oldBismark</code> flag. A future version of this software will support the use of BAM files created with other popular bisulfite aligners such as <a href="https://code.google.com/p/bsmap/">BSMAP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BenLangmead/bsmooth-align">BSmooth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brentp/bwa-meth/">bwa-meth</a>, <a href="http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/">gsnap</a>, <a href="http://last.cbrc.jp/">last</a> and <a href="http://www.novocraft.com/">Novoalign</a>. Support will either be provided natively in <code>comethylation</code> or via an pre-processing script <code>bismarkify</code>.</p>

<p>The main options to pass <code>comethylation</code> are the size of the m-tuple (<code>--mTuple</code>); the type of methylation, which is some combination of <em>CG</em>, <em>CHG</em>, <em>CHH</em> and <em>CNN</em> (<code>--methylationType</code>); any filters to be applied to reads or positions within reads (see below); the BAM file; and the sample name, which will be used as a prefix for all output files. </p>

<p>To simultaneously study multiple methylation types the <code>--methylationType</code> parameter must be specified multiple times, e.g. to study CG and CHH methylation <code>--methylationType CG --methylationType CHH</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="output" class="anchor" href="#output"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Output</h2>

<p>Three output files are created and summary information is written to <code>STDOUT</code>.</p>

<p>The main output file is a tab-delimited file of all m-tuples (<code>&lt;sampleName&gt;.&lt;--methylationType&gt;.&lt;--mTuple&gt;.tsv</code>). </p>

<p>Here are the 5 rows (along with the header row) from <code>data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2.CG.2.tsv</code>, which is created by running the single-end directional example shown below:</p>

<pre><code>chr     pos1        pos2        MM  MU  UM  UU
chr10   42383637    42383660    1   0   0   0
chr10   42383660    42383672    0   2   0   0
chr10   42383672    42383686    0   0   2   0
chr10   42385004    42385040    1   0   0   0
chr10   42385040    42385063    1   0   0   0
</code></pre>

<p>So, for the CpG 2-tuple chr10:(42,383,637, 42,383,660) we observed 1 read that was methylated at chr10:42,383,637 and methylated at chr10:42,383,660. For CpG 2-tuple chr10:(42,383,660, 42,383,672) we observed 2 reads that were both methylated at chr10:42,383,660 but unmethylated at chr10:42,383,672.</p>

<p>The second file (<code>&lt;sampleName&gt;.&lt;--methylationType&gt;_per_read.hist</code>) is a text histogram of the number of methylation loci per read or readpair (of the type specified by <code>--methylationType</code>) that passed the filters specified at runtime of <code>comethylation</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the file <code>data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2.CG_per_read.hist</code>, which is created by running the single-end directional example shown below:</p>

<pre><code>n       count
0       4389
1       2262
2       750
3       287
4       131
5       55
6       27
7       18
8       3
9       4
10      2
11      1
12      3
13      4
14      1
18      2
</code></pre>

<p>So, 4,389 reads aligned to a position with no CpGs while 2 reads aligned to a position with 18 CpGs.</p>

<p>An optional third and final file (<code>&lt;sampleName.reads_that_failed_QC.txt&gt;</code>) records the querynames (<code>QNAME</code>) of all reads that failed to pass quality control filters and which filter the read failed. This file may be omitted by use of the <code>--noFailedQCFile</code> flag.</p>

<p>Here are the first 2 rows of <code>data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2.reads_that_failed_QC.txt</code>, which is created by running the single-end directional example shown below:</p>

<pre><code>SRR921747.5_JONAS:2105:C0G2AACXX:4:2205:18672:56112_length=101  read has indel
SRR921747.81_JONAS:2105:C0G2AACXX:4:2205:18836:56196_length=101 read has indel
</code></pre>

<p>So, both of these reads were filtered out because they contained indels (see section "<strong>Limitations and notes</strong>").</p>

<h2>
<a name="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h2>

<p>Two small example datasets are included in the <code>data/</code> directory. Included are the <code>FASTQ</code> files and the <code>BAM</code> files generated with <strong>Bismark</strong> in <strong>Bowtie2</strong> mode. More details of the example datasets can be found in <code>data/README.md</code></p>

<p>Although the example datasets are both from directional bisulfite-sequencing protocols, <code>comethylation</code> works with data from both directional and non-directional bisulfite-sequencing protocols.</p>

<h3>
<a name="single-end" class="anchor" href="#single-end"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Single-end</h3>

<p>The following command will extract all CpG 2-tuples from the file <code>data/se_directional.bam</code>:</p>

<pre><code>comethylation --mTuple 2 --methylationType CG data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2.bam data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2
</code></pre>

<p>This results in 3 files: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2.CG.2.tsv</code></li>
<li><code>data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2.CG_per_read.hist</code></li>
<li><code>data/se_directional.fq.gz_bismark_bt2.reads_that_failed_QC.txt</code></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="paired-end" class="anchor" href="#paired-end"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Paired-end</h3>

<p>Paired-end data must firstly be sorted by queryname prior to running <code>comethylation</code>. <code>BAM</code> files created by Bismark, such as <code>data/pe_directional.bam</code>, are already sorted by queryname. So, to extract all CG/CHH 3-tuples we would simply run:</p>

<pre><code>comethylation --mTuple 3 --methylationType CG --methylationType CHH --strandSpecific data/pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe.bam data/pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we had to specify <code>--strandSpecific</code> because <strong>CHH</strong> methylation is not symmetric between the Watson and Crick strands.</p>

<p>This results in 3 files: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>data/pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe.CG_CHH.3.tsv</code></li>
<li>
<code>data/pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe.CG_CHH_per_read.hist</code> </li>
<li><code>data/pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe.reads_that_failed_QC.txt</code></li>
</ul><p>If your paired-end BAM file is sorted by genomic coordinates, then you must first sort the <code>BAM</code> by queryname and then run <code>comethylation</code> on the queryname-sorted <code>BAM</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Create a coordinate-sorted BAM for the sake of argument
samtools sort data/pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe.bam data/cs_pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe
# Re-sort the coordinate-sorted BAM by queryname
samtools sort -n data/cs_pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe.bam data/qs_pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe
# Run comethylation on the queryname sorted BAM
comethylation --mTuple 3 --strandSpecific --methylationType CG --methylationType CHH data/qs_pe_directional_1.fq.gz_bismark_bt2_pe.bam data/qs_pe_directional
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="memory-usage-and-running-time" class="anchor" href="#memory-usage-and-running-time"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Memory usage and running time</h2>

<p>Memory usage is dependent upon the number of methylation loci on the chromosome (more methylation loci means increased memory usage) and the value of <code>--mTuple</code> (roughly, larger values means increased memory usage), but largely independent of the number of reads in the <code>BAM</code> file. In contrast, running time is dependent on the number of reads in the <code>BAM</code> file and largely independent of the choice of <code>--mTuple</code>.</p>

<p>I will include more detailed performance benchmarks in future releases. For a rough indication of performance, here are the results for processing approximately 41,000,000 100bp paired-end reads from chr1 of a 20-30x coverage whole-genome methylC-seq experiment of human data. This analysis used a single AMD Opteron 6276 CPU (2.3GHz) on a shared memory system.</p>

<h3>
<a name="--mtuple-2" class="anchor" href="#--mtuple-2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><code>--mTuple 2</code>

<p>Memory usage peaked at 2.9GB and the running time was approximately 1.5 hours. </p>

<a name="--mtuple-5" class="anchor" href="#--mtuple-5"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><code>--mTuple 5</code>

<h2>
<a name="helper-script" class="anchor" href="#helper-script"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Helper script</h2>

<p>I frequently work with large, coordinate-sorted <code>BAM</code> files. To speed up the extraction of m-tuples I use a simple (naive) parallelisation strategy. The idea is to split the <code>BAM</code> file into chromosome-level <code>BAM</code> files, process each chromosome-level <code>BAM</code> separately and then recombine these chromosome-level files into a genome-level file. The script <code>helper_scripts/run_comethylation.sh</code> implements this strategy; simply edit the key variables in this script.</p>

<h3>
<a name="warnings" class="anchor" href="#warnings"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Warnings</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: This simple strategy uses as many cores as there are chromosomes. This can result in <strong>very</strong> large memory usage, depending on the value of <code>--mTuple</code>, and may cause problems if you have more chromosomes than available cores.</li>
<li>
<strong>WARNING</strong>: The script <code>tabulate_hist.R</code> must be in the same directory as <code>run_comethylation.sh</code>

<p><code>comethylation</code> makes use of Bismark's custom SAM tags <code>XM</code>, <code>XR</code> and <code>XG</code>. The <code>XM</code> tag is used to infer the methylation state of each sequenced cytosine while the <code>XR</code> and <code>XG</code> tags are used to infer the orientation and strand of the alignment. If the data were aligned with Bismark version &lt; 0.8.3 please use the <code>--oldBismark</code> flag.</p>

<p>A future version of this software will support the use of <code>BAM</code> files created with other popular bisulfite aligners such as <a href="https://code.google.com/p/bsmap/">BSMAP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BenLangmead/bsmooth-align">BSmooth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brentp/bwa-meth/">bwa-meth</a>, <a href="http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/">gsnap</a>, <a href="http://last.cbrc.jp/">last</a> and <a href="http://www.novocraft.com/">Novoalign</a>. Support will either be provided natively in <code>comethylation</code> or via an pre-processing script <code>bismarkify</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/PeteHaitch/comethylation/issues/30">Issue #30</a></p>

<p>This is required in order to avoid lookups when finding the mate of a paired-end read.</p>

<p>The <code>BAM</code> file created by Bismark is natively in queryname order so this is not a problem. If the file is not in queryname order then use <code>samtools sort</code> with the <code>-n</code> option to sort you <code>BAM</code> by queryname. The helper script <code>helper_scripts/run_comethylation.sh</code> works with a coordinate-sorted <code>BAM</code> file and so includes a step to sort the chromosome-level <code>BAM</code> files by queryname.</p>

<p>It is difficult, although not impossible, to assign coordinates to a cytosine within an indel. To avoid this complication, <code>comethylation</code> currently skips any reads containing an indel. I aim to improve the handling of indels in the next release.</p>

<a name="the---oldbismark-option-is-a-bit-crude" class="anchor" href="#the---oldbismark-option-is-a-bit-crude"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The <code>--oldBismark</code> option is a bit crude</h2>

<p>Specifically, it assumes that there are no '/' characters in the read names (<code>QNAME</code>) and that the BAM has not been processed with any other programs, e.g. Picard's MarkDuplicates, that might change the <code>FLAG</code> field. I am happy to improve this functionality if requested.</p>

<h2>
<a name="memory-usage-can-be-large" class="anchor" href="#memory-usage-can-be-large"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Memory usage can be large</h2>

<p>For instance, 5-20Gb per chromosome for a typical 20-30x coverage whole-genome methylC-seq experiment of human data. I think this is largely due to inefficiencies in how I store the m-tuples internally in <code>comethylation</code> (which is basically as a dictionary of dictionaries). See <a href="https://github.com/PeteHaitch/comethylation/issues/64">Issue #64</a></p>

<a name="other-notes" class="anchor" href="#other-notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bismark always sets the mapping quality (<code>mapQ</code>) as the value 255, which means unavailable in the SAM format specification. Thus the <code>--minMapQ</code> option will not have any effect for Bismark data.</li>
<li>
<code>comethylation</code> skip paired-end reads where either mate is unmapped.</li>
